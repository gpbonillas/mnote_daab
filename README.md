# Raywenderlich Dart API with Google Cloud Run 

REST API using Dart (Dart as a backend) Google Cloud Run. 
This app was implemented with the tutorial [Building Dart APIs with Google Cloud Run](https://www.raywenderlich.com/31602619-building-dart-apis-with-google-cloud-run#toc-anchor-024).

With tutorial we built a Dart REST API called `MNote`, a note management API that any Flutter app can consume. In the process, we learned how to:

- Develop and run servers in Dart using the shelf and shelf_router packages.
- Intercept and manipulate HTTP requests and responses using middleware.
- Create a Docker image for your project.
- Deploy a Dart API on Google Cloud Run.
